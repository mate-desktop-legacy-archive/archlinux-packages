# Introduction

These are the [PKGBUILD files](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PKGBUILD)
that produce [MATE desktop](http://www.mate-desktop.org) packages for
[Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org).

Binary packages are built from these PKGBUILD files periodically sent via
`rsync` to the official MATE repository for Arch Linux and via `burp` to the AUR.

# Developing MATE packages for Arch Linux

Any help you can offer is most welcomed. The following will hopefully help.

## Submitting bugs

Please submit Arch Linux packaging bugs for MATE desktop to the
[archlinux-packages](https://github.com/mate-desktop/archlinux-packages)
GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/mate-desktop/archlinux-packages/issues?state=open).

## Fixing bugs

If you fix a bug in one of the MATE desktop PKGBUILDs, please submit a
pull-request to the [archlinux-packages](https://github.com/mate-desktop/archlinux-packages)
GitHub repository. Please **do not** submit a new PKGBUILD to the
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/), this just creates confusion.

## Common issues

Here are some common issues you may run into when packaging MATE desktop components
for Arch Linux.

### PKGBUILD depends

Some common `depends` for a MATE related package are:

#### gtk3

Most MATE 1.7 packages require `gtk3` and the `gtk3` package for Arch Linux
automatically pulls in the following:

  * `atk`
    * `glib2`
  * `pango`
    * `libthai`, `cairo`, `libxft`, `harfbuzz`
  * `libxcursor`
    * `libxfixes`, `libxrender`
      * `libx11`
        * `libxcb`, `xproto`, `kbproto`
  * `libxinerama`
    * `libxext`, `xineramaproto`
  * `libxrandr`
    * `libxext`, `libxrender`, `randrproto`
  * `libxi`
    * `libxext`, `inputproto`
  * `libxcomposite`
    * `libxfixes`, `compositeproto`
  * `libxdamage`
    * `libxfixes`, `damageproto`
  * `shared-mime-info`
    * `libxml2`, `glib2`
  * `cairo`
    * `libpng`, `libxrender`, `libxext`, `fontconfig`, `pixman`, `glib2`, `mesa`, `libgl`, `sh`,  `lzo2`
  * `libcups`
    * `gnutls`, `libtiff`, `libpng`, `krb5`, `avahi`
  * `gtk-update-icon-cache`
    * `gdk-pixbuf2`

Therefore if `gtk3` is in your PKGBUILD `depends`, then none of the
above need to be listed.

### PKGBUILD makedepends

`mate-common` is a build requirement, it is probably required by any
MATE related package. It **should not** need to be listed in the
PKGBUILD `depends` as this would install on an end-users system, it
should only be listed in `makedepends`.

`yelp-tools` is also a build requirement, it should only be listed in
`makedepends`.

### Python

As the time of writting any Python programs/libraries in MATE 1.7 require
Python 2. However, Python 3 is the default on Arch Linux therefore
PKGBUILDs need to force the use of `python2` in the following ways:

  * Set the `PYTHON` environment variable to `/usr/bin/python2`
  * Change the Python interpreter in shebang of any Python "executables".

Examples of all of the above can be found in the
[mate-applets](https://github.com/mate-desktop/archlinux-packages/blob/master/mate-applets/PKGBUILD)
PKGBUILD file.

### libexec

Arch Linux does not have a `/usr/libexec` directory. Therefore if any
packages install files to `/usr/libexec` the PKGBUILD needs to set
`--libexecdir=/usr/lib/${pkgname}` via `configure` or `autogen.sh`
otherwise the application in question will not work.

An example of this can be found in the
[mate-power-manager](https://github.com/mate-desktop/archlinux-packages/blob/master/mate-power-manager/PKGBUILD)
PKGBUILD file.

### sbin

Arch Linux recently moved all binaries to `/usr/bin`. Therefore if any
packages install files to `/usr/sbin` the PKGBUILD needs to set
`--sbindir=/usr/bin` via `configure` or `autogen.sh` to avoid
conflicting with the `filesystem` package.

An example of this can be found in the
[mate-control-center](https://github.com/mate-desktop/archlinux-packages/blob/master/mate-control-center/PKGBUILD)
PKGBUILD file.

# Building MATE packages

If you want to help the MATE packaging team for Arch Linux then you'll
likely want to build MATE packages yourself to test your changes before
submitting a pull-request.

## Use a chroot

It is highly recommended that you use a `chroot` to create a sandbox for
building the MATE packages.
[archroot-builder](https://github.com/flexiondotorg/archroot-builder)
can assist with that.

## builder.sh

`builder.sh` is a shell script that can build the entire MATE package
tree for Arch Linux, and do some other useful stuff. You'll find it in
the same directory as this README. `./builder.sh -h` will help get you
started, but the magic incantation is:

    ./builder.sh -t build

The above will automatically build every package in the tree, or just
build those packages that have newer PKGBUILDs that are currently
unbuilt. You can also audit the build status using:

    ./builder.sh -t audit

This will provide lots of useful information about each package in the
tree and also automatically create updated `.install` files in `/tmp`.

### Build and Package logs

If you have difficulty getting a package to build, then `builder.sh`
will keep a build and package log file for each package. This can be
useful to identify missing requirements or to share with the MATE
developers so they can assist. The MATE developers like the logs pasting
here:
